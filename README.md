#  Irish Residential Property Price Register

In 2010, a residential property house price register was set up in Ireland, listing the addresses of houses sold and the price for which they were sold. 

Information on this register and access to the database is available [here](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en). 

The list of houses sold in a town during a single year can be viewed by putting the town name in the address line and filling in the county, year, and January to December in the relevant boxes.
